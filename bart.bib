abstract = {Bartonella henselae has been implicated as a causative agent of chronic uveitis in people and in some cats. The objective of this study was to determine whether Bartonella species seroprevalence or titer magnitude varies among cats with uveitis, cats without ocular diseases recorded and healthy cats, while controlling for age and risk of flea exposure based on state of residence. There was no difference in seroprevalence rates or titer magnitude between cats with uveitis and cats with non-ocular diseases. Healthy cats were more likely to be seropositive for Bartonella species than cats with uveitis. The median Bartonella species titer was 1:64 for all groups, although healthy cats were more likely to have higher titers than cats with uveitis and cats with non-ocular disease. The results suggest that serum antibody tests alone cannot be used to document clinical uveitis associated with Bartonella species infection.},

Cats are the mammalian reservoir and vector for Bartonella henselae, an important zoonotic agent. Cat fleas transmit Bartonella among cats, and cats with fleas are an important source of human B henselae infections. New information about Bartonella as feline pathogens has recently been published, and this article summarizes much of that information. Issues surrounding diagnosis and treatment of feline Bartonella infections are described, and prevention of zoonotic transmission of Bartonella is discussed.},

abstract = {Cat exposure has been directly associated with the development of human Bartonella henselae infections, resulting in cat-scratch disease, bacillary angiomatosis, or bacteremia. The prevalence of serum antibody titers to B. henselae was determined for selected pet cats from 33 geographic locations throughout the United States and several areas in western Canada. Seroprevalences paralleled increasing climatic warmth (P < .02) and annual precipitation (P < .03). These warm, humid areas with the highest seroprevalence would also have the highest number of potential arthropod vectors. The southeastern United States, Hawaii, coastal California, the Pacific Northwest, and the south central plains had the highest average prevalences (54.6\%, 47.4\%, 40.0\%, 34.3\%, and 36.7\%, respectively). Alaska, the Rocky Mountain-Great Plains region, and the Midwest had low average prevalences (5.0\%, 3.7\%, and 6.7\%, respectively). Overall, 27.9\% (175/628) of the cats tested were seropositive. The seroprevalence of B. henselae in cats varies throughout the United States and appears to be influenced by climate.},

Afebrile control cats (39/93; 42.0\%) were more likely to have Bartonella species antibodies than cats with fever (29/93; 31.2\%). The difference in prevalence of Bartonella species deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in blood of cats with fever (14/81; 17.3\%) as compared to afebrile control cats (6/81; 7.4\%) approached statistical significance (P=0.0571). Bartonella species ELISA or WB results frequently did not correlate to the presence or absence of Bartonella species DNA in blood. The results of this study indicate that in cats, Bartonella species antibody tests cannot predict whether fever is due to Bartonella species infection and should not be used to determine the Bartonella species infection status.},

The usefulness of serum and aqueous humor (AH) antibody testing for these agents is limited as antibodies can be detected in both healthy cats and cats with uveitis. Very few studies using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays to amplify organism DNA from samples from cats with uveitis have been performed. In this study, assays to detect T gondii antibodies, feline leukemia virus antigen, feline immunodeficiency virus antibody, and Bartonella species antibodies were performed on serum and PCR assays for amplification of T gondii, Bartonella species, and FHV-1 DNA were performed on blood and AH samples from 104 cats with endogenous uveitis and 19 healthy cats. Results suggest the addition of the PCR assay to the diagnostic work-up for cats with uveitis will increase the detection of T gondii and FHV-1; however, the diagnostic usefulness of these additional data is not clear.},

Blood samples were obtained for Bartonella species isolation and immunofluorescent antibody serology from 298 cats presenting to a tertiary referral hospital. Medical records were searched and the history, physical examination findings and the results of diagnostic testing relating to the visit at which Bartonella species testing was performed were recorded. Fifty-two (17\%) samples were seropositive for Bartonella henselae, four (1\%) for Bartonella clarridgeiae, and 57 (19\%) for both organisms. Nineteen (6.4\%) samples were culture positive, 17 for B henselae and two for B clarridgeiae. Gingivostomatitis was associated with Bartonella species isolation (P=0.001), but not seropositivity. There was no association with uveitis, neurologic signs, or chronic kidney disease, and a weak association between seropositivity and idiopathic lower urinary tract disease (feline interstitial cystitis) (P=0.05).},
